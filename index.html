                A lot of people tell me I look like George Bush, so I am his super secret body double on the side, but
                my real passions are Stuart Little and Godzilla. After countless hours of researching my favorite things
                ever, I had a brilliant idea: to create the first-ever website dedicated to fans of these two things.
                This is that website. Welcome to my happy place.
